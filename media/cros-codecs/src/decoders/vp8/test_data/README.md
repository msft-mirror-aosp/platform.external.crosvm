# VP8 Test Data

This document lists the test data used by the VP8 decoder.

Note that fair use is claimed on all non-copyleft clips, as their the purpose is only for testing,
technical evaluation, and documentation.

Unless otherwise noted, the CRCs were computed using GStreamer's VA-API decoder in
`gst-plugins-bad`.

## test-25fps.vp8

Same as Chromium's `test-25fps.vp8`.
